**Unit 7: Storage and I/O** <span id="7"></span> 
*In this unit, we will discuss the input/output devices that enable
communication between computers and the outside world in some form. The
reliability of these devices is important; we will accordingly discuss
the related issues of dependability, availability, and reliability. You
will also take a look at non-volatile storage mediums, such as* *disk
and flash memory, before learning about mechanisms used to connect the
computer to input/output devices. This unit will conclude by discussing
disk system performance measures.*

**7.1 I/O Devices** <span id="7.1"></span> 
-   **Lecture: YouTube: Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi: Anshul
    Kumar’s “I/O Subsystem: Introduction”**

    [“I/O Subsystem:
    Introduction”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XybwAbup-w) (YouTube)  
      
     Instructions: Watch this lecture, which discusses the basic ideas
    behind the input/output (I/O) subsystem of a computer system. The
    lecturer also looks into performance measurement for I/O devices and
    interfaces used to interconnect I/O devices to the processor. This
    is the first of two video lectures on I/O. A computer subsystem
    consists of three major components: processor, memory, and
    connections. The key words in the previous sentence aresubsystemand
    connections. To be useful, a computer system needs to have
    connections with external devices to get data and control signals
    into the computer and to put data and control signals out. The
    external devices can be other systems or other systems may be
    connected to the same devices. Thus, our computer system is part of
    a network of a few or many other subsystems interconnected to
    perform useful tasks.  
      
     We are always interested in how well a task is performed, in terms
    of time, capacity, and cost. In considering performance relative to
    our useful task, we have to consider processor performance, memory
    performance, and the performance of the connections, including the
    performance of the external devices. This first video lecture looks
    at external or peripheral devices and I/O performance. The next
    video in subunit 7.2 discusses interfaces, buses, and I/O
    transfer.  
        
     Watching this lecture and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes.

**7.2 Connecting I/O Devices to the Processor** <span id="7.2"></span> 
-   **Lecture: YouTube: Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi: Anshul
    Kumar’s “I/O Subsystem: Interfaces and Buses”**
    Link: YouTube: Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi: Anshul Kumar’s
    [“I/O Subsystem: Interfaces and
    Buses”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myVbSSyZtr4) (YouTube)  
      
     Instructions: Watch this lecture for an introduction to the
    interconnection schemes used for the input/output (I/O) subsystem of
    a computer system. This is the second of two lectures on I/O
    devices. The previous lecture looked at the connection of memory,
    either cache or main memory, with peripheral devices and the
    transfer and transformation of data between them. This video lecture
    analyzes alternative interconnection schemes with a focus on buses.
    Also, it discusses protocols for the data that flows on the buses:
    asynchronous and synchronous. A *synchronous protocol*uses a clock
    to time sequence the information flow. An *asynchronous
    protocol*does not use a clock; the signal carries the sequencing
    information. Then, the lecture shows a performance comparison of two
    different protocols.  
        
     Watching this lecture and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes.

    Characteristics”](http://resources.saylor.org.s3.amazonaws.com/CS/CS301/CS301-7.3-Harddiskdriveperformancecharacteristics-Wikipediathefreeencyclopedia-CCBYNCSA_files/CS301-7.3-Harddiskdriveperformancecharacteristics-Wikipediathefreeencyclopedia-CCBYNCSA.html) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this article. Disks have various
    characteristics, which determine quality attributes, such as
    reliability, performance, etc. Here, we are interested in
    performance. Think of some characteristics that affect performance.
    How can performance of a disk be measured?
