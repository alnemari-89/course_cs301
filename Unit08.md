**Unit 8: Parallel Processing** <span id="8"></span> 
*This unit will address several advanced topics in computer
architecture, focusing on the reasons for and the consequences of the
recent switch from sequential processing to parallel processing by
hardware producers. You will learn that parallel programming is not
easy and that parallel processing imposes certain limitations in
performance gains, as seen in the well-known Amdahl’s law. You will also
look into the concepts of shared memory multi-processing and cluster
processing as two common means of improving performance with
parallelism. The unit will conclude with a look at some of the
programming techniques used in the context of parallel machines.*

**8.2 Limitations in Parallel Processing: Amdahl’s Law** <span

    High-Performance Scientific Computing*: “Chapter 2: Parallel
    Computer Architecture”**

    Computer
    Architecture”](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbookuploads/5345_scicompbook.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read sections 2.1 and 2.2 of Chapter 2 on pages 41–45
    to learn about parallel computer architectures. There are different
    types of parallelism: there is instruction-level parallelism, where
    a stream of instructions is simultaneously in partial stages of
    execution by a single processor; there are multiple streams of
    instructions, which are simultaneously executed by multiple
    processors. The former was addressed in Unit 5. The latter is
    addressed in this reading. A quote from the beginning of the chapter
    states the key ideas: “In this chapter, we will analyze this more
    explicit type of parallelism, the hardware that supports it, the
    programming that enables it, and the concepts that analyze it.” This
    reading begins with a simple scientific computation example,
    followed by a description of SISD, SIMD, MISD, and MIMD
    architectures.  
      
     Reading these sections should take approximately 30 minutes.

-   **Reading: Ariel Ortiz Ramírez’s “Parallelism and Performance”**
    Link: Ariel Ortiz Ramírez’s [“Parallelism and
    Performance”](http://resources.saylor.org.s3.amazonaws.com/CS/CS301/CS301-8.2-ParallelismandPerformance-CCBYNCSA_files/CS301-8.2-ParallelismandPerformance-CCBYNCSA.html) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Study the section titled “Amdahl’s Law.” *Amdahl’s
    law* explains the limitations to performance gains achievable
    through parallelism. Over the last several decades or so, increases
    in computer performance have largely come from improvements to
    current hardware technologies and less from software
    technologies. Now, however, the limits to these improvements may be
    near. For significant continued performance improvement, either new
    physical technology needs to be discovered and/or transitioned to
    practice, or software techniques will have to be developed to get
    significant gains in computing performance.  
      
     In the equation for Amdahl’s law, P is the fraction of code that
    can be parallelized, i.e., that must be executed serially; S is the
    fraction of code that cannot be parallelized; and n is the number of
    processors. Note P + S is 1. If there are n processors, then P + S
    can be executed in the same time that P/n + S can be executed. Thus,
    the ratio of the time using 1 processor to the time of using n
    processors is 1/(P/n + S). This is the speedup in going from 1
    processor to n processors.  
      
     Note that the speedup is limited, even for large n. If n is 1, the
    speedup is 1. If n is very large, then the speedup is 1/S. If P is
    very small, then P/n is even smaller, and P/n + S is approximately
    S, i.e., the speedup is 1/S, but S is approximately S + P, which is
    1. Therefore, the speed of execution of this code using 1 processor
    is about the same as using n processors.  
      
     Another way of writing Amdahl’s law is 1/(P/n + [1 – P]). Thus, if
    P is close to 1, the speedup is 1/(P/n) or n/P, which is
    approximately n.  
      
     Apply Amdahl’s law to better understand how it works by
    substituting a variety of numeric values into this equation and
    sketching the graph of the equation.  
      
     Studying this section and applying Amdahl’s law should take
    approximately 1 hour.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read section 2.3 of Chapter 2 on pages 46 and 47 to
    learn about different types of memory access. Then, read section 2.4
    of Chapter 2 on pages 47–51 to learn about granularity of
    parallelism. A processor’s connections to memory affect its
    performance. Parallel machines can be connected to memory in
    different ways, so there are different ways to handle simultaneous
    access by multiple processors to the same memory location.
    Parallelism can be on various levels: control signal level (or
    micro-program instruction level), data level, computation level, or
    task level. This reading is a prelude to the next key topic of
    parallel programming in subunit 8.4.  
        
     Reading this section should take approximately 1 hour.

    parallelism is handled by the programmer. MPI is applicable in the
    second case.
