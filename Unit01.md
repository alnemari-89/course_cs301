**Unit 1: Introduction to Computer Technology** <span id="1"></span> 
*In this unit, we will discuss various advances in technology that have
led to the development of modern computers. You will begin your study
with a look at the different components of a computer. We will then
discuss the ways in which we measure hardware and software performance
before discussing the importance of computing power and how it motivated
the switch from a single-core to a multi-core processor. *

**The Saylor Foundation's Unit 1 Assessment** <span id="1.7"></span> 
*The unit assessments are designed to not only assess but also to
provide supportive instruction and to help integrate the units. This
course sits on the fence between software and hardware; software is CS
(Computer Science) and hardware is EE (Electrical Engineering).
Understanding this boundary between software and hardware is essential
to computer architecture. In addition, supportive material will help
those who do not have much hardware background. The assessments are
designed to help you think about the material, to look back over the
unit, to take a glimpse ahead to the next unit, to integrate the
concepts presented in the unit, and to connect them to the course and
unit learning outcomes.*

    requires you to sketch out some milestones in the history of
    computer technology. Once you have completed the assessment, or if
    you need help, refer to the [Answer
    Key](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/CS301-Computer-Architecture-Assessment-1-Answer-Key.FINAL_.pdf).  
      
     Completing this assessment should take approximately 1 hour and 30
