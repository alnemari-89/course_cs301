Course Syllabus for "CS301: Computer Architecture"
--------------------------------------------------

Modern computer technology requires an understanding of both hardware
and software, as the interaction between the two offers a framework for
mastering the fundamentals of computing. The purpose of this course is
to cultivate an understanding of modern computing technology through an
in-depth study of the interface between hardware and software. In this
course, you will study the history of modern computing technology before
learning about modern computer architecture and a number of its
important features, including instruction sets, processor arithmetic and
control, the Von Neumann architecture, pipelining, memory management,
storage, and other input/output topics. The course will conclude with a
look at the recent switch from sequential processing to parallel
processing by looking at the parallel computing models and their
programming implications.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:  

-   identify important advances that have taken place in the history of
    modern computing, and discuss some of the latest trends in computing
    industry;
-   explain how programs written in high-level programming language,
    such as C or Java, can be translated into the language of the
    hardware;
-   describe the interface between hardware and software, and explain
    how software instructs hardware to accomplish desired functions;
-   explain the process of carrying out sequential logic design;
-   explain computer arithmetic hardware blocks and floating point
    representation;
-   explain how a hardware programming language is executed on hardware
    and how hardware and software design affect performance;
-   explain the factors that determine the performance of a program;
-   explain the techniques that designers use to improve the performance
    of programs running on hardware;
-   explain the importance of memory hierarchy in computer design, and
    explain how memory design impacts overall hardware performance;
-   describe storage and I/O devices, their performance measurement, and
    redundant array of inexpensive disks (more commonly referred to by
    the acronym RAID) technology; and
-   identify the reasons for and the consequences of the recent switch
    from sequential processing to parallel processing in hardware
    manufacture, and explain the basics of parallel programming.

 **Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned
materials. Pay special attention to units 1 and 2 as these lay the
groundwork for understanding the more advanced, exploratory material
presented in the latter units. You will also need to complete
assessments at the end of each unit and the final exam.  
    
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final
exam. However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will
need to work through all of the resources in the course.  
    
 In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
your final exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you approximately **109.25
hours.** This course also includes approximately 19 hours of optional
material. Each unit includes a time advisory that lists the amount of
time you are expected to spend on each subunit. These should help you
plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at these
time advisories, to determine how much time you have over the next few
weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for yourself. For
example, unit 1 should take you 10.5 hours. Perhaps you can sit down
with your calendar and decide to complete subunits 1.1 and 1.2 (a total
of 2.5 hours) on Monday night; subunits 1.3 and 1.4 (a total of 3.5
hours) on Tuesday night; subunits 1.5 and 1.6 as well as the assessment
(a total of 4.5 hours) on Wednesday and Thursday nights; etc.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions:** As noted in the “Course Requirements” section, it
helps to have basic knowledge of computer programming using a high-level
language such as C/C++. If you are struggling with concepts in this
course, it may help to take a break to revisit [CS101: Introduction to
Computer Science I](http://www.saylor.org/courses/cs101/) and [CS102:
Introduction to Computer Science
II](http://www.saylor.org/courses/cs102/).
