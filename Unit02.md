**Unit 2: Instructions: Hardware Language** <span id="2"></span> 
**In order to understand computer architecture, you need to understand
the components that comprise a computer and their interconnections. Sets
of instructions, called* *programs,* *describe the computations that
computers carry out. The instructions are strings of binary digits. When
symbols are used for the binary strings, the instructions are called*
*assembly languageinstructions. Components interpret the instructions
and send signals to other components that cause the instruction to be
carried out.*  
    
 *In this unit, you will build on your knowledge of programming from*
[CS102](http://www.saylor.org/courses/cs102/) *to learn how to program
with an assembly language. You will use the instructions of a real
processor, MIPS, to understand the basics of hardware language. We will
also discuss the different classes of instructions typically found in
computers and compare the MIPS instructions to those found in other
popular processors made by Intel and ARM.**
